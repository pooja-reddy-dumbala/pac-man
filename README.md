The motivation behind this project is to harness the capabilities of reinforcement learning to develop an intelligent agent capable of playing the iconic game Pac-Man. Reinforcement learning, a subset of machine learning, offers a robust framework for training agents to navigate and make decisions in dynamic environments. Pac-Man, with its complex maze, strategic decision-making, and adversarial components in the form of ghosts, serves as an ideal testbed for showcasing the capabilities of reinforcement learning algorithms.
By implementing a Q-learning agent for Pac-Man, we aim to delve into the intricacies of training an agent to learn optimal strategies through trial and error. This project serves as a practical demonstration of how reinforcement learning techniques can be applied to classic gaming scenarios, unraveling the potential for artificial intelligence to adapt and excel in dynamic and challenging environments.
